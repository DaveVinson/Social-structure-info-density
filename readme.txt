The “analysis” folder contains all scripts and the “data” folder (below). First use the “ngram_builder.py” to build the frequency tables needed for future analysis (these files are already in the “data” folder). All other scripts are linked within the “0-main-script.R” file. Use this file as a reference to other code and analyses. It will point to scripts that show you how to build local social networks from yelp reviews “build.nets.R” and how to quantify the language of reviews using information theoretic tools “get.reviews.R”. As well as analyzing those reviews to assess the relationship between linguistic structure and network structure. 

The “data” folder nested within the ‘analysis’ folder contains all data necessary to replicate our findings detailed in the manuscript.  Many of the scripts below help build some of the files within the “data” folder. You do not need to rebuild these files from scratch, though you can if you like. You will need access to free data on Yelp’s website to do this: yelp.com/datset_challenge/
